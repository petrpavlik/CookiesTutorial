# CookiesTutorial

This is an example implementation of a website written in Swift using the Vapor framework that uses cookies for user authentication.
The goal is to show how to do user auth in a secure way that is resistant to the most common cookie stealing attacks, such as XSS or XSRF.

I'd like to follow up with a video or a blog post where I use this codebase to explain cookie-based web vulnerabilities t expecially iOS developers who would like to learn more about web development.

## Getting Started

To build the project using the Swift Package Manager, run the following command in the terminal from the root of the project:
```bash
swift build
```

To run the project and start the server, use the following command:
```bash
swift run
```

To execute tests, use the following command:
```bash
swift test
```
